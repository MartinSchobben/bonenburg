To recreate the article: A comparative study of total organic carbon-13C signatures in the Triassic–Jurassic transitional beds of the Central European Basin and western Tethys shelf seas, published in Newsletters on Stratigraphy, run the R Markdown file (.Rmd) with knitr (1.20) (Xie 2014, 2015, 2018). Instructions on the installation and the usage of Rmarkdown for Rstudio can be found on the website: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/. After unzipping the file, the Rmd file can be found under the directory: report. Several additional packages are required to recreate data processing, statistics and visualization of the geochemical datasets, including: ggplot2 (2.2.1) (Wickham 2009), gridExtra (2.3) (Auguie 2017), ggtern (2.2.1) (Hamilton 2017), broman (0.67-4) (Broman & Broman 2017), dplyr (0.7.5) (Wickham et al 2018), gtable (0.2.0) (Wickham 2016) and kfigr (1.2) (Koohafkan 2015). On lines 5, 7 and 35, the pathway to the directory: supplement, needs to be completed.
